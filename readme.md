# ChatDown Library & Explorer

Two projects in this repo:

## ChatDown Explorer

Enables you to write chatdown code and see it live in the embedded bot emulator window.

Done in pure HTML and Javascript, reusing the chatdown tools (https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools)

Drop the files in a folder and run the ChatDownExplorer.html locally. No need for a webserver.

An experimental version with the Monaco editor is also available.

### Try it

Here: https://lambot.blob.core.windows.net/public/ChatDownExplorer.html

or here with the Monaco editor: https://lambot.blob.core.windows.net/public/ChatDownExplorer_monaco.html

## Possible future developments 

with no specific order:
- Choose between Monaco or Textarea version
- Develop a cooperative solution that enables two persons to build the chat performing role playing in two different computers. One is the bot, the other is a user.
- Enable the Chat to be run live in a bot.
- Improve the page user experience with better navigation and arrange the buttons and overall functionality.
